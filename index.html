    <h1>Hi, I'm Lluvia (shoo·vee·ah),</h1>
    <h2>My foundation comes from scientific research, data analysis (Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience), 
        and communication and language skills (Certified ESL Teacher). 
        My work in those fields allowed me to learn to work effectively with people of diverse backgrounds and made it possible for me to transition into the field of social work.
        For the past two years I had the privilage of serving unaccompanied children entering the U.S. as refugees and gained experience in navigating complex systems and advocating for vulnerable populations.
        Currently, I am excitingly persuing a certification in software engineering, which will provide me with valuable technical skills and new opportunities.
